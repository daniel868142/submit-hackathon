You are tasked with evaluating the similarity between two trades in the context of a specific parameter. Your goal is to provide a similarity score from 1 to 100, where 1 means completely different and 100 means identical. Pay close attention to the format and wording of the trades, but do not focus on numerical differences.

Here is the description of the basic trade:
```
Sell 10y SOFR swap at 3.45%
```

Here is the description of the trade to be evaluated:
```
Sell 5y SOFR swap at 2.90%
```

The parameter for comparison is described as follows:
```
The words Buy or Sell, or the words Pay Fixed or Receive Fixed
```

Analyze the two trade descriptions, focusing on their similarities and differences in the context of the given parameter. Consider the structure, wording, and overall format of the trades, but do not place emphasis on specific numerical values that may differ.

Provide a detailed justification for your similarity assessment, explaining the key factors that influenced your decision. Consider both the similarities and the differences you observed.

After your justification, assign a similarity score from 1 to 100, where:
0 = The trades are completely different in terms of the given parameter
100 = The trades are identical in terms of the given parameter

Act as a Senior Quantitative Analyst tasked with evaluating the similarity in how the description of
a specific parameter is placed within the description of two different trades, so your junior colleague can be
provided an example of how to properly separate the description of this parameter from the rest of the trade.

Your goal is to provide a similarity score from 1 to 100, where 1 means completely different and 100 means identical.
Pay close attention to the format and wording of how the parameter is described, but ignore any differences between
numerical or textual values of this parameter as well as other parameters within the trade.

Here is the description of the first trade:
```
Sell 10y SOFR swap at 3.45%
```

Here is the description of the second trade:
```
Vanilla swap on 3m Term SOFR at 2.90%, we pay fixed, 10y maturity
```

The parameter for comparison is described as follows:
```
The words Buy or Sell, or the words Pay Fixed (which for this trade type means Buy) or Receive Fixed (which for this trade type means Sell).
```

Analyze the two trade descriptions, focusing only on the similarities and differences how this parameter is
placed within the trade description.
Consider the structure, wording, and overall format of the trade descriptions, but ignore any differences between
numerical or textual values of this parameter as well as other parameters within the trade.

Provide a detailed justification for your similarity assessment, explaining the key factors that influenced your decision.
Consider both the similarities and the differences you observed.

After your justification, assign a similarity score from 1 to 100, where:
0 = The trades are completely different in terms of the given parameter
100 = The trades are identical in terms of the given parameter

Present your response in JSON with the following format:
{
    ""analysis"": <Your detailed justification for the similarity assessment, single line>,
    ""similarity_score"": <Your numerical score between 0 and 100>
}","{
    ""analysis"": ""The two trade descriptions differ significantly in how they present the buy/sell parameter. The first trade starts with 'Sell' directly, making it clear and prominent. The second trade uses 'we pay fixed' later in the description, which is equivalent to 'Buy' for this trade type, but it's not as immediately apparent and requires interpretation. The placement and directness of this information vary considerably between the two descriptions."",
