_TEMPLATE = """Act as a Senior Quantitative Analyst tasked with evaluating the similarity in how the description of
a specific parameter is placed within the description of two different trades, so your junior colleague can be
provided an example of how to properly separate the description of this parameter from the rest of the trade.

Your goal is to provide a similarity score from 1 to 100, where 1 means completely different and 100 means identical.
Pay close attention to the format and wording of how the parameter is described, but ignore any differences between
numerical or textual values of this parameter as well as other parameters within the trade.

Here is the description of the first trade:
```
{BasicTrade}
```

Here is the description of the second trade:
```
{EvaluatedTrade}
```

The parameter for comparison is described as follows:
```
{ParameterDescription}
```

Analyze the two trade descriptions, focusing only on the similarities and differences how this parameter is
placed within the trade description.
Consider the structure, wording, and overall format of the trade descriptions, but ignore any differences between
numerical or textual values of this parameter as well as other parameters within the trade.

Provide a detailed justification for your similarity assessment, explaining the key factors that influenced your decision.
Consider both the similarities and the differences you observed.

After your justification, assign a similarity score from 1 to 100, where:
0 = The trades are completely different in terms of the given parameter
100 = The trades are identical in terms of the given parameter

Present your response in JSON with the following format:
{{
    "analysis": <Your detailed justification for the similarity assessment, single line>,
    "similarity_score": <Your numerical score between 0 and 100>
}}
