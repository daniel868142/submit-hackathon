You must reply with JSON formatted strictly according to the JSON specification in which all values are strings.
The JSON must have the following keys:

{
    ""success"": <Y if at least one piece of information was found and N otherwise. This parameter is required.>
    ""annotated_text"": ""<The input text where each piece of information about this parameter is surrounded by curly braces. There should be no changes other than adding curly braces, even to whitespace. Leave this field empty in case of failure.>,""
    ""justification"": ""<Justification for your annotations in case of success or the reason why you were not able to find the parameter in case of failure.>""

Input text: ```ten million dollars```
Parameter description: ```Numerical value of the amount (including possible space, commas and other
decimal point and thousands separators between digits) or its text representation (e.g. 'ten') 
including any scale unit such as  'm' or 'millions', 'b' or 'bn' or 'billions' but excluding any
currency symbols such as '$', 'USD' or 'dollars'.

Ensure you do not include anything other than digits and scale units, even if additional non-digit
symbols such as a currency symbol are not separated by a space from the digits which may happen
especially with the currency amount.
